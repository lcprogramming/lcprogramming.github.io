Here are some of the ideas that got tossed around at today's meeting:

## Robot
Idea: build a rover-style robot to use for experiments, etc, using something like an RC truck for the base. This project would involve CAD, soldering, circuit design, and embedded systems programming.

**To get involved:** Contact Quinn Rohlf

## Social Media "No Loner Bon-ing" app
An app to get a lunch buddy so that you don't have to Bon alone.  Would involve networking, app development.

## Mountain Finder App
An app that lets you know what mountains you're looking at by pointing a smartphone at them.

## Magic The Gathering App
An app that lets you play Magic online.

## App to find people to train with (workout buddies)
Use location data, etc. to find people to train with (like with Parkour). ****talk to him about this because Chris Gueits might be down.

## HvZ website for Lewis & Clark
HvZ, or Humans vs Zombies is a massive game of tag that plays out over the course of a week. Check out OSU's HvZ page to get a better idea of what it's all about: http://www.osundead.com. It would be great to make an HvZ game happen at LC. This project would involve web development, and possibly some iOS/Android development.
